# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1, 2021 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Made most of my get_pdf_docs program, which downloads the Python documentation from https://docs.python.org/3/download.html.

**Thoughts:** I felt like by making it, I was getting a little bit better at Python. I did not hesitate to make this program, I sort of just got on with it, which is weird for me, but it is a nice change. I hope it carries on.

### Day 2: February 2, 2021 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Mostly done with get_pdf_docs, but I want to add a bit more to it!

**Thoughts**: I felt happy that I got the program mostly done. It only has one use, but it is useful to me. Better than downloading the documentation manually for sure.

(skipped a day due to assignment, but keeping it going anyway)

### Day 3: February 4, 2021 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: I feel that I could have been programmed more today. I was programming on my Chromebook (yes, don't laugh), and I accidentally shut it down and now the Terminal won't open because "Linux Beta needs an update" or something. I am now on my PC and have tried to code a little bit. I will try to be more productive tomorrow.

**Thoughts** Yeah, today was not great tbh :/.

**Link(s) to work**: haven't done much on GitHub today :/

### Day 4: February 5, 2021 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Made a NotifyIcon with event calls working in C#. But I was trying to contribute to a project and I couldn't figure it out until now.. I am for sure dumb as a rock.

**Thoughts**: I felt slightly annoyed, but I still feel motivated!
