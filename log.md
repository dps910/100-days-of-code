# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1, 2021 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Made most of my get_pdf_docs program, which downloads the Python documentation from https://docs.python.org/3/download.html.

**Thoughts:** I felt like by making it, I was getting a little bit better at Python. I did not hesitate to make this program, I sort of just got on with it, which is weird for me, but it is a nice change. I hope it carries on.

**Link to work:** [get_pdf_docs](https://github.com/dps910/scripts/tree/master/get_pdf_docs)

### Day 2: February 2, 2021 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Mostly done with get_pdf_docs, but I want to add a bit more to it!

**Thoughts**: I felt happy that I got the program mostly done. It only has one use, but it is useful to me. Better than downloading the documentation manually for sure.

**Link(s) to work**: [get_pdf_docs](https://github.com/dps910/scripts/tree/master/get_pdf_docs)

(skipped a day due to assignment, but keeping it going anyway)

### Day 3: February 4, 2021 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: I feel that I could have been programmed more today. I was programming on my Chromebook (yes, don't laugh), and I accidentally shut it down and now the Terminal won't open because "Linux Beta needs an update" or something. I am now on my PC and have tried to code a little bit. I will try to be more productive tomorrow.

**Thoughts** Yeah, today was not great tbh :/.

**Link(s) to work**: haven't done much on GitHub today :/

### Day 4: February 5, 2021 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Made a NotifyIcon with event calls working in C#. But I was trying to contribute to a project and I couldn't figure it out until now.. I am for sure dumb as a rock.

**Thoughts**: I felt slightly annoyed, but I still feel motivated!

**Link(s) to work**: didn't upload anything on GitHub today.

### Day 5: February 6, 2021 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Started writing a script that can upload files to google drive from the command line.

**Thoughts**: It was great, I think I maybe could have done a bit more today?

**Link(s) to work**: It will be here when it's finished [gdrive_uploader](https://github.com/dps910/scripts/tree/master/gdrive_uploader)

### Day 6: February 7, 2021 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: I started porting halium to my phone so I can install Ubuntu Touch!

**Thoughts**: Today has been great! I did a page of my assignment this morning and I have almost finished building the kernel for my phone. Hopefully I can get past the errors etc.

**Link(s) to work**: I will upload to GitHub once I get it working. I need to try it for myself so I can let people know what works and what doesn't.
